## 🍕 Pizza Sales and Performance Analytics — Project Problem Statement

A local pizza chain is seeking to optimize its business operations, enhance customer satisfaction, and boost revenue. Despite having a structured relational database consisting of `orders`, `order_details`, `pizza`, and `pizza_types`, the management lacks meaningful insights to make data-driven decisions.

As a Data Analyst, your role is to explore the pizza sales data using advanced SQL queries and deliver actionable insights that support business strategy and operations.
