## ‚úÖ Step 1: Top Ingredients by Frequency (Across All Pizzas)

We need to split ingredients (which are stored as comma-separated values) and count their frequency across all pizzas.

Uses JSON_TABLE to split ingredients ‚Äî much faster and cleaner than SUBSTRING_INDEX loops.

```sql
WITH exploded_ingredients AS (
    SELECT 
        pt.pizza_type_id,
        TRIM(ingredient) AS ingredient
    FROM 
        pizza_types pt,
        JSON_TABLE(
            CONCAT('["', REPLACE(pt.ingredients, ', ', '","'), '"]'),
            '$[*]' COLUMNS (ingredient VARCHAR(255) PATH '$')
        ) AS jt
)
SELECT 
    ingredient,
    COUNT(DISTINCT pizza_type_id) AS pizza_count
FROM 
    exploded_ingredients
GROUP BY 
    ingredient
ORDER BY 
    pizza_count DESC;
```
