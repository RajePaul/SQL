# üçï Top 3 Pizzas per Category Analysis

In this analysis, we identify the top 3 performing pizzas **within each category** using four different advanced SQL queries. This helps us understand not just the best overall pizzas, but the **leaders in each category** by quantity, revenue, and per-order performance.

---

üîç Objective :

To determine the **top 3 pizzas per category** using:
1. Total Quantity Sold
2. Total Revenue Generated
3. Average Quantity per Order
4. Average Revenue per Order

### üß† SQL Concepts Used
- `RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY ...)`: Advanced window function to rank pizzas *within each category*.
- Aggregation with `SUM()`, `COUNT(DISTINCT ...)`, and `ROUND()`
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Multi-level ordering and filtering




## üî¢ 1. Top 3 Pizzas per Category by Total Quantity Sold

```sql
WITH pizza_sales AS (
    SELECT 
        pt.category,
        pt.name AS pizza_name,
        SUM(od.quantity) AS total_quantity,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY pt.category ORDER BY SUM(od.quantity) DESC) AS rk
    FROM 
        order_details od
    JOIN pizza p ON od.pizza_id = p.pizza_id
    JOIN pizza_types pt ON p.pizza_type_id = pt.pizza_type_id
    GROUP BY pt.category, pt.name
)
SELECT 
    category,
    pizza_name,
    total_quantity
FROM 
    pizza_sales
WHERE 
    rk <= 3
ORDER BY
